Welcome! Today's class will cover some of the most useful ways you can use `git log` to search your project history.

Full `git log` documentation is [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log).

### Command Line History

See `git-log-cli-command-history` to view a chronological history of just the commands typed in class. See `git-log-cli-output` to view a copy/paste of the entire Terminal session, i.e. both the commands and their output.
